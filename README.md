# OSU_PrintingHelper
version 1.1.0

## Introduction

This is a printing application for the Ohio State University. The intention of creating this application is to help student to print their documents using department printers more efficiently. The project currently is still under construction.

## Usage

For now, my app only supports printing pdf files, you can upload your pdf files onto your email box, dropbox or some other platform. And in these apps, you need to use "Open in" function to copy your file to the local folder of my app. After that, you need to add your OSU account, then you are good to print!
