# OSU-Printer
version 1.0

It's an ios app which can help OSU students to experience faster and easier printing, this app uses SSH connections to
upload local files to the OSU servers, and prints the uploaded files via shell commands.
This version is a beta version, I will rewrite some classes and add comments for the later version.
